# Todo
- [ ] Add bedding, tent, or hammock packing (mount points on backpack)


# Organizational Tools
Throughout this guide I will use a combination of items to organize and protect the e    quipment on the list.  This includes:
- Twist Ties
- Plastic Bendy Twist Ties
- Soft cases
- Soft containers
- Shopping bags
- Ziplock bags
- Garbage bags
- Silica Packs (To keep moisture sensitive items dry)


# Backpack Selection
The core component is the selection of the best backpack. The best choice in backpack is something with hip support and buckles, multiple large pockets, and does not "stand out" when wearing (not tactical, military, Hello Kitty, neon colors, etc...

For this guide, I have chosen the [Kelty Redwing 44 Tactical in Forest Green](https://tinyurl.com/25w883pa)

The guide will be broken up into each compartment of the backpack.  Adjust the list or groups based upon your selected packpack (If you don't go with the Kelty 44)
