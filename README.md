This is a guide on making the perfect bugout backpack for camping or any emergency situation. 

# Core: Backpack and Storage
The core component is the selection of the best backpack. The best choice in backpack is something with hip support and buckles, multiple large pockets, and does not "stand out" when wearing (not tactical, military, Hello Kitty, neon colors, etc...

For this guide, I have chosen the [Kelty Redwing 44 Tactical in Forest Green](https://tinyurl.com/25w883pa)

In addition to the backpack, throughout this guide I will use a combination of items to organize and protect the equipment on the list.  This includes:

- Twist Ties
- Soft cases
- Soft containers
- Shopping bags
- Sandwich bags
- Garbage bags

The guide will be broken up into each compartment of the backpack.  Adjust the list or groups based upon your selected packpack (If you don't go with the Kelty 44)

# Front compartment
The front compartment consists of important items that are easily accessible when the pack is closed up
